Hi, I'm Ajay, a 2nd-year B.Tech IT student at School of Engineering, CUSAT.
My areas of interest include Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Iot, Embeddded System and Web development.

I enjoy learning by doing and strongly believe in building projects that create real-world impact.  
Currently, I am working on strengthening my knowledge of Python and C++, while also exploring Arduino and ESP32 for hardware projects.
My long-term goal is to become a Robotics Engineer who integrates AI and intelligent automation into robotics to solve everyday problems.  
I also want to contribute to open-source projects and build a strong portfolio that reflects my skills and passion.

Alongside my core interests, I make efforts to explore and stay updated in other related fields.
